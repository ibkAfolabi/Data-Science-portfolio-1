# [Project 1: Segmenting Customers of Different Products](https://github.com/ibkAfolabi/Data-Science-portfolio-1/blob/main/DataScienceGroup1.R)
  
  The focus of this project is to be able to segment existing customers into clusters and study their characteristics so as to use this information to know what kind of prospects   to target. We intent to cluster the prospects to see if their characteristics match our existing customers and target them.
   
  Tasks involved;
  
    •	Visualize the data to discover outlier if any.
    •	Apply hierarchical clustering with Euclidean distance and Ward’s method. 
    •	Compare the cluster centroid to characterize the different clusters, and try to give each cluster a label.
    •	To check the stability of the clusters.
    •	Determine the most suitable k.
    •	Use k-means clustering to get the clusters in the data using the most suitable
    •	Create the profile of each clusters
    •	Which clusters would you target for offers, and what types of offers would you target to customers in that cluster

# [Project 2: Start-Up /  Market Exploration](https://github.com/ibkAfolabi/Data-Science-portfolio-1/blob/main/assign2codes.R)
Now the availability of social media as a marketing tool brings commercialization and expansion within reach of hundreds of thousands of would-be entrepreneurs, and their financial backers. And because social media has become the communication vehicle of choice for many in the artisan community, it is an important channel for established supply companies whose marketing budgets are not similarly constrained. In the following problems, use social network graph visualizations and metric along with inspection of the data, to learn something about the network.

Tasks involved;

•	Create a network from edge list of the commenters. 
•	Who are the influential users/commenters in each of the two samples? 
•	Compare the list of influential users in the two samples (recent  data and month year ago) to detect loyal users.
•	Select the three most influential commenters in each sample and collect information on these users. Calculate the egocentric network of the three most influential commenters in each sample
•	 Can you discern and describe marketing campaigns based on this analysis?
•	In the network discovered, using the number of common neighbors score, predict the next link to form (that is, suggest which new link has the best chance of success).
